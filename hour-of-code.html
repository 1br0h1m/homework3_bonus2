      Team 19 from ADA University visited the “Gencler Evi” in Suraxani to
      engage sixth grade students in a hands-on coding workshop.The session
      aimed to introduce basic programming concepts and spark interest in
      technology. Despite limited resources, the team utilized the Code.org
      platform, making the session interactive and accessible. The visit began
      with an introduction to ADA University, highlighting its mission,and
      faculties. This motivated students to visualize their future in technical
      sciences. The workshop focused on coding concepts like algorithms, loops,
      and conditional statements, explained through examples and practical
      tasks.

      We would like to thank the students for their warm welcome because, as ADA
      University representatives, we wanted them to feel at home and show them
      what being part of the uniersity could offer. We presented ourselves, our
      names, areas of study, and the purpose of our visit to their school: to
      take their university experience to them and spark an early interest in
      technology and education. We then went further to say something about the
      ADA University, specifying its mission, core values, and the available
      unique opportunities. This is where we paid attention to ADA determination
      to create capable graduates in the field of technical sciences and other
      areas, together with the congenial atmosphere of the university.

    <p>
      We were able to receive feedback from the students at the end of the
      session regarding what they felt and their reactions toward this new
      experience. Many described enjoying the process and shared how the work
      with coding seemed like a fun game—more than a lesson—and we took that as
      a positive indicator. They also said that in the future, they want to have
      more activities related to coding, and that was an encouraging signal
      indicating our efforts were fruitful.
